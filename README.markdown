# Enchanted Vim

This is a vim script which makes searches with `\v` (very magic) persistent.
You can turn it off temporarily with 
```viml
  let g:VeryMagic = 0 (default is 1)
```
or if you are already in the command line you can type `\m` or `\M` (see :help
`\m`).  There are also: very magic `substitute`, `global` and `vimgrep`
(`lvimgrep`), which you have to turn on if you want to use them:
```viml
  let g:VeryMagicSubstitute = 1  " (default is 0)
  let g:VeryMagicGlobal = 1  " (default is 0)
  let g:VeryMagicVimGrep = 1  " (default is 0)
  let g:VeryMagicSearchArg = 1  " (default is 0, :edit +/{pattern}))
  let g:VeryMagicFunction = 1  " (default is 0, :fun /{pattern})
  let g:VeryMagicHelpgrep = 1  " (default is 0)
  let g:VeryMagicRange = 1  " (default is 0, search patterns in command ranges)
  let g:VeryMagicEscapeBackslashesInSearchArg = 1  " (default is 0, :edit +/{pattern}))
  let g:SortEditArgs = 1  " (default is 0, see below)
```

The `g:VeryMagicSearchArg` turns on the support for very magic `:edit +/pat
file` for various commands which accepts this syntax, i.e. `edit`, `view`,
`visual`, `ex`, `split`, `vsplit`, `new`, `vnew`, `sview`, `find`, `sfind`.
Furthermore with `g:VeryMagicEscapeBackslashesInSearchArg` the backslashes in
the `+/` argument will be escaped (yes vim requires that and probably not only
I forget about this) if there is at least one unescaped backslash (this
prevents from double escaping when resuing the command from command history).
You still need to escape backslashes when you run `vim +/\\vpat` from the
command line, e.g. `vim +"/\\vpattern" file.vim`.

If you set `g:SortEditArgs = 1` the arguments for `:edit` like commands will
be reordered.  This allows to use `:edit file.txt +/pattern` which will be
reordered into `:edit +/pattern file.txt`.

If you use `incsearch` setting, you probably want to use `g:VeryMagic = 0` and
set two mappings:
```viml
nm / /\v
nm ? ?\v
```
otherwise `incsearch` will not work for patterns which contains non
alphanumeric characters.

## How it works
It simply injects `\v` at the beginning of your pattern *after you press enter*
or after c&#95;CTRL-f.

Note: if you are using one of the two other of my plugins which are defining
maps to &lt;CR&gt; in the command line, you need to update them to the latest
version so that they will all work:
* [System](https://github.com/coot/System)
* [CommandAlias](https://github.com/coot/cmdalias_vim)

## Macros

The plugin works well with vim macros which involve a search command like `/`.
Used register will not contain `\v` but it will by added when you play it.

# Requirements
You have to also install
[CRDispatcher](https://www.github.com/coot/CRDispatcher) plugin.
